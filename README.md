# K-D Tree (KDT) Introduction

## Overview

This repository provides an introduction to K-D Tree (KDT), a data structure used for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. The KDT template is implemented in Python and provided in `KDT.py`. Additionally, `KDT.md` can be considered as a study note on KDT.

## Files

- `KDT.py`: Contains the Python implementation of the K-D Tree template. This implementation includes basic operations such as insertion, deletion, range search, and nearest neighbor search.
- `KDT.md`: Serves as a study note or documentation for understanding K-D Tree, its structure, operations, and applications.

## Example

In this repository, you will also find an example problem:

- `[清华集训2016] 汽水`: This is an OI (Olympiad in Informatics) problem that the author completed a few years ago. The file contains the C++ code that was implemented during a high school exam. It serves as an example of how K-D Tree can be applied in competitive programming.

For more information about the problem, please refer to the [Luogu article](https://www.luogu.com.cn/article/5yejxp1x).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Code

To run the K-D Tree implementation, simply execute `KDT.py`:

```sh
python KDT.py
